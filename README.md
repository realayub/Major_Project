# SDN-based Metering Mechanism Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on the development and evaluation of a Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-based metering mechanism aimed at selectively metering the bandwidth usage of specific IP addresses. The research addresses the challenges associated with implementing meters in SDN environments and explores solutions for effective bandwidth management and Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning.

## Background
The growth of the Internet has led to diverse networking applications with unique data flow requirements. Traditional QoS mechanisms like Integrated Services (IntServ) and Differentiated Services (DiffServ) face scalability and complexity issues. SDN emerges as a solution by decoupling the control plane from the data plane, enabling centralized network management and dynamic resource optimization.

## Problem Definition
Key challenges in SDN-based metering include managing meters at scale, determining appropriate granularity, minimizing performance overhead, ensuring interoperability across different vendors, and translating high-level QoS policies into specific meter configurations. Addressing these challenges is crucial for efficient network performance and resource management.

## Research Objective
The primary objective is to develop an SDN-based metering mechanism that selectively meters bandwidth for specific IP addresses while allowing others to remain unmetered. The project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of fine-grained bandwidth management, assess its impact on network performance, and explore its scalability in different network conditions.

## Methodology
1. **SDN Controllers**: Utilize the Ryu controller, a Python-based SDN controller, for managing network devices and implementing the metering mechanism.
2. **OpenFlow**: Leverage OpenFlow protocols for communication between the SDN controller and network devices, focusing on QoS support across different OpenFlow versions.
3. **Mininet**: Use Mininet to simulate realistic network topologies and test the implementation of the metering mechanism.

## Implementation
1. **Topology Setup**: Design and implement network topologies using Mininet.
2. **Controller Programming**: Develop controller programs using the Ryu controller to manage and configure meters.
3. **Testing with Meters**: Conduct tests to evaluate the effectiveness of the metering mechanism and its impact on network performance.

## Conclusion
The project aims to provide insights into the use of selective bandwidth metering for optimizing network resources, enforcing QoS policies, and maintaining high performance in diverse network environments. It also addresses the challenges of dynamic adjustment and real-time monitoring of metered traffic.
